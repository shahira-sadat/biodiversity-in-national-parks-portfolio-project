# Biodiversity in National Parks Portfolio Project
Code Academy Data Science Path Portfolio Project Biodiversity in National Parks


## Project Overview

This project explores the biodiversity in national parks using species data and observations. The analysis involves merging and analyzing data from two datasets: species_info.csv containing information about species, including their category, scientific names, common names, and conservation status; and observations.csv providing details about species observations across different national parks.


## Project Objectives

1. Data Loading and Inspection
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
3. Data Integration and Analysis
4. Visualizations
5. Summary and Insights

## Prerequisites

Ensure that you have a solid understanding of the following topic:

- Python Fundamentals
- Data Acquisition and Preprocessing
- Data Visualization with Matplotlib and Seaborn
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Pandas for Data Manipulation

## Files

The repository includes the following files:

- species_info.csv: Dataset containing information about species.
- observations.csv: Dataset with observations data from national parks.
- biodiversity_analysis.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook containing detailed analysis description, code, and visualizations.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:shahira-sadat/biodiversity-in-national-parks-portfolio-project.git

   ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory:**

   ```bash
   cd biodiversity-in-national-parks-portfolio-project

   ```

3. **Open the Jupyter Notebook:**

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook

   ```

4. **Start exploring the OKCupid_Data_Analysis.ipynb notebook:**

   ```bash
   biodiversity_analysis.ipynb
   ```

## Overview

The script does the following:

1. Loading Data:

   - Load species_info.csv and observations.csv.
   - Check data shapes and basic statistics.

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

   - Visualize species distribution across categories and conservation statuses.
   - Analyze observations per park and species category.
   - Explore mean observations per park and conservation status.

3. Data Integration and Visualization::

   - Merge datasets to analyze species observations in parks.
   - Plot total observations of species in national parks.
   - Visualize mean observations per park and per species category.

4. Insights and Conclusions:
   - Summarize findings on species distribution, observations, and conservation statuses.


Feel free to modify and extend the script according to your needs.
